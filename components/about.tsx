              based in Hyderabad, India. Originally from Andhra Pradesh, I
              discovered my passion for coding in 2017 during my first year of
              diploma studies. Starting with C, I faced challenges but
              persevered, eventually finding my footing with Java. This journey
              ignited my love for programming, leading me to explore web
              development. When I discovered JavaScript and the React ecosystem,
              I knew I had found my calling.
